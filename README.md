# Scouting Instant Challenges

[The Boy Scouts of America](https;//www.scouting.org) (BSA)  has a strong focus on skills and leadership development.  However, much of the curriculum emphasizes rote memorization of skills, often done in fixed environments.  This is the same at most BSA skills events such as Camporee, where teams can rehearse events in their entirety.  While these skills are invaluable, they do not exercise other skills, such as improvisation and rapid decision-making, that are needed for the kinds of dynamic changes in today's environment. Real life is significantly more dynamic, and the current curriculum does not deliberately exercise skills needed to meet these kind of challenges, such as improvisation and rapid decision making.  

To meet this need, we adapted [Destination Imagination's Instant Challenge](https://www.destinationimagination.org/blog/instant-challenge-inspiring-teams-to-think-on-the-spot/) to the Scouting format.  Instant Challenges (ICs) are timed tasks where a team is given a novel task and has to develop a solution under time pressure.  Teams are graded not just on whether they can perform the task, but also on their creativity and their ability to work as a team.

We at [Alameda Troops 2 and 7](https://www.alamedatroop2.com/home) have created several Scouting Instant Challenges that exercise creative application of Scouting skills to new and unexpected environments.  We have trialed multiple Scouting ICs and have found them to be fun and a good way to develop the attributes needed to meet the challenges of a constantly-changing world.
