# Scouting Instant Challenges

[The Boy Scouts of America](https;//www.scouting.org) (BSA)  has a strong focus on skills and leadership development.  However, much of the curriculum emphasizes rote memorization of skills, often done in fixed environments.  This is the same at most BSA skills events such as Camporee, where teams can rehearse events in their entirety.  While these skills are invaluable, they do not exercise other skills, such as improvisation and rapid decision-making, that are needed for the kinds of dynamic changes in today's environment. Real life is significantly more dynamic, and the current curriculum does not deliberately exercise skills needed to meet these kind of challenges, such as improvisation and rapid decision making.  

To meet this need, we adapted [Destination Imagination's (DI) Instant Challenge](https://www.destinationimagination.org/blog/instant-challenge-inspiring-teams-to-think-on-the-spot/) to the Scouting format.  Instant Challenges (ICs) are timed tasks where a team is given a novel task and has to develop a solution under time pressure.  Teams are graded not just on whether they can perform the task, but also on their creativity and their ability to work as a team.

We at [Alameda Troops 2 and 7](https://www.alamedatroop2.com/home) have created several Scouting Instant Challenges that exercise creative application of Scouting skills to new and unexpected environments.  We have trialed multiple Scouting ICs and have found them to be fun and a good way to develop the attributes needed to meet the challenges of a constantly-changing world.

## Notes <a id="notes"/>

Following are some notes from our experiences running these exercises at Scout Troop meetings.  While every unit's context can be very different, we hope these will help you adapt these ICs for your needs.

#### Asking Questions and Loopholes
At the heart of every IC are a set of possible loopholes that can be exploited by teams if they are read closely and are clever enough.  Judges running the challenge will need to remember to only answer within what is written on the rules-sheet: Everything else is allowed and nothing is forbidden (outside of ethical and safety limits).  Our goal is to encourage Scouts to develop creative workarounds and hacks to achieve their goals.

#### Group Activity Issues: Noise and Peeking
Two major issues arise from the fact that our Troops meet in a gym: The noise level and the ability for participants to peek over at other teams and copy their solutions.  Destination Imagination Instant Challenge sessions take place in rooms with just one team and the appraiser, which is infeasible for moderate-sized Troops and larger.  Indeed, it is likelier you will have to run all teams concurrently in the same shared space, such as a church gym or a school cafeteria.  The first and largest consequence of this is the noise level will be high, as you will have several teams trying to develop their solution at the same time.  Some DI ICs are performance based, and these cannot work as well in a noisy environment.  Possible solutions to this include:

- Avoid performance-based ICs.
- Have each team perform one-at-a-time.
- Have ICs where [the goal is to stay silent](./challenges/silent_signal_IC.pdf).

The second is peeking: If one team has developed a novel solution, other teams will observe them and implement that solution.  Dealing with this can be trickier, as it requires the judges to keep an eye on their team and see if they are simply copying their neighbor's solution.  This is mitigated by the fact that our scoring rubrics favor good teamwork and leadership, and oftentimes a team can rank highly without actually completing the task by scoring well on those attributes.
